# 🔐 Lab 02 – Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

**Objective:**  
Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) access for Azure AD admin roles using approval workflows and MFA.

## 🧭 Overview
Privileged Identity Management (PIM) enhances security by limiting standing admin privileges.  
In this lab, we configured eligible roles, activation approval, and alerts for privileged access.

## 🧩 Steps Summary
1. Enable **PIM** in Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID).  
2. Assign **eligible roles** (e.g., Global Administrator).
